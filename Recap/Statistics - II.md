# Statistics - II

#### General Tips
* Qualitative variables take on values that are names or labels (categorical)
* A measurable characteristic of a *population* (eg. mean) is called a *parameter*; but a measurable characteristic of a *sample* is called a *statistic*
* When sampling with replacement, sample size can be greater than population size
* Uniform distribution: When the observations in a set of data are equally spread across the range of the distribution. It has no clear peaks.

#### Mean vs Median
The median may be a better indicator of the most typical value if a set of scores has an outlier.   
However, when the sample size is large and does not include outliers, the mean score usually provides a better measure of central tendency.

#### Sample Variance
Observations from a simple random sample can be used to estimate the variance of a **population**  
s^2 = Σ ( xi - x )^2 / ( n - 1 )  
If population data is given, use n in denominator

#### Standard Score / Z score
Z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. z = (X - μ) / σ

####  Interquartile range is equal to Q3 - Q1

#### Outlier
As a "rule of thumb", an extreme value is often considered to be an outlier if it is at least 1.5 interquartile ranges below the first quartile (Q1), or at least 1.5 interquartile ranges above the third quartile (Q3).
