# Naive Bayes

### What is "Naive" about the naive bayes?
The "Naive" in Naive Bayes refers to its strong and often unrealistic assumption of conditional independence among features (predictor variables), given the class label.

The Core of Bayes' Theorem:
Bayes' Theorem provides a way to calculate the probability of a class (C) given a set of features (X):
P(C∣X)= P(X∣C)∗P(C)/P(X)
Where:
P(C∣X): The posterior probability of class C given the features X.
P(X∣C): The likelihood of observing features X given that the class is C.
P(C): The prior probability of class C.
P(X): The evidence, or the marginal probability of observing features X. (This term is often ignored in classification because it's constant for all classes, so we only need to compare the numerators.)

The "Naive" Assumption
This is where the "naive" part comes in. The Naive Bayes classifier simplifies this joint probability by making a crucial assumption:

It assumes that each feature xi is conditionally independent of every other feature xj given the class C.

P((x1,x2,..)/C)=P(x1/C)*P(x2/c)...
​
We drop P(X) from the denominator because it's a constant for all classes, and we're only interested in which class has the highest posterior probability).

Why is this "Naive"?In real-world data, features are rarely truly conditionally independent.

Why Does it Still Work Well?
* Classification vs. Probability Estimation: Naive Bayes often doesn't need to estimate the exact probabilities, just the rank of the probabilities. Even if the individual probabilities are inaccurate due to the independence assumption, if the highest posterior probability still corresponds to the correct class, the classification will be correct.
* Robustness to Violations: In many real-world scenarios, features are only weakly dependent, or the dependencies "cancel out" across different classes.
* Simplicity and Efficiency: The naive assumption dramatically simplifies the calculations. This makes Naive Bayes extremely fast to train and predict, even with very high-dimensional data (like text data with thousands of words as features). It requires less training data to estimate the necessary parameters compared to models that try to capture all feature dependencies.
* Curse of Dimensionality: By decoupling the feature probabilities, Naive Bayes effectively mitigates the "curse of dimensionality," which can plague more complex models in high-dimensional spaces.

#### What is Marginal Probability?
The term "marginal probability" comes from the practice of writing probability values in the margins of a joint probability table. This table shows the probabilities of two or more variables occurring together.
Here's the key idea: to find the probability of a single variable, you sum or integrate across all possible values of the other variables, and this sum is traditionally written in the table's margins. This process of "summing out" or "integrating out" the other variables is called marginalization.
