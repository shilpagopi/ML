# Probability
* Probability mass function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.
* Probability density function (PDF) is associated with continuous random variables. A PDF must be integrated over an interval to yield a probability
* Thinking of probability as mass because similar to conervation of physical mass, the total probability for all hypothetical outcomes is 1.

#### Probability Distribution
* Bernoulli distribution: models sample sapce with 2 possible outcomes. P(x) = p or 1-p. Eg: Coin toss. 
* Binomial distribtuion: models the number of successes when someone draws n times with replacement. P(n) = C(n,k) (p^k)((1-p)^(n-k)). Eg: 1 head in 6 trials.
* Geometric dsitribution: models  number of trials needed to get one success. Eg. Toss until head
  

#### Expected value and Variance:
* Expected value = Summation over all i outcomes of (P(xi)* x(i))
* If delta = (X-u)^2, Variance = E(delta) = Summation over all i outcomes of (P(xi)* deltai)

The probability of Team A winning exactly k games in n games is given by:
* P(X=k)=(NCk)(p^k)(1-p)^(nâˆ’k)

#### Questions
* What is the probability that a seven-game series goes to 7 games?
