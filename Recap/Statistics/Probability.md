# Probability
* Probability mass function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.
* Probability density function (PDF) is associated with continuous random variables. A PDF must be integrated over an interval to yield a probability
* Thinking of probability as mass because similar to conervation of physical mass, the total probability for all hypothetical outcomes is 1.

#### Probability Distribution
* Bernoulli distribution: models sample sapce with 2 possible outcomes. P(x) = p or 1-p. Eg: Coin toss. 
* Binomial distribtuion: models the number of successes when someone draws n times with replacement. P(n) = C(n,k) (p^k)((1-p)^(n-k)). Eg: 1 head in 6 trials.
* Geometric dsitribution: models  number of trials needed to get one success. Eg. Toss until head
  

#### Expected value and Variance:
* Expected value = Summation over all i outcomes of (P(xi)* x(i))
* If delta = (X-u)^2, Variance = E(delta) = Summation over all i outcomes of (P(xi)* deltai)

#### The probability of Team A winning exactly k games in n games is given by:
* P(X=k)=(NCk)(p^k)(1-p)^(nâˆ’k)

#### Coupon Collector's Problem with n distinct items:
E=n*summation over 1 to n(1/i) 
Expected no. of buys to collect all n different coupons.

#### Questions
* What is the probability that a seven-game series goes to 7 games?
* What is the probability that two random chords in a circle will intersect? 1/3
* What is the expected number of rolls needed to see all 6 sides of a fair die? (1+6/5+6/4+6/3+6/2+6/1) = 14.7
  The number of rolls needed to get all six numbers is the sum of number of rolls to get each number. That is, it is the number of rolls to get the first unique number plus the number of rolls to get the second number, plus the number of rolls to get the third number, et cetera.

To get the first number, there are six possible outcomes, of which all six qualify. The expected number of rolls to get the first number is 6/6=1.

To get the second number, there are six possible outcomes, of which five qualify; the number initially rolled does not qualify. The expected number of rolls to get the second unique number is 6/5.

How do we know it takes 6/5 rolls to get the second number? Define p so that p = the expected number of rolls.

If we roll and duplicate the first number, then we need to roll again. The expected number of rolls to get the second number when we don't get it on the first try = 1+p.

If we roll and don't duplicate the first number, we are done. The expected number of rolls is 1.

The overall expected number of rolls is the probability of duplicating the first number times the expected number of rolls when we duplicate the first number plus the probability of not duplicating the first number times the expected number of rolls when we don't duplicate the first number.

Or, p = (1/6)*(1+p) + (5/6)*1

p = 1/6 + p/6 + 5/6

p - p/6 = 1/6 + 5/6

p * 5/6 = 1

p = 6/5

Similarly, the number of rolls for the third number is,

p = (2/6)*(1+p) + (4/6)*1

p - (2/6)*p = (2/6) + (4/6)

p = 6/4

The overall number of rolls is,

6/6+6/5+6/4+6/3+6/2+6/1

= 1+1.2+1.5+2+3+6

= 14.7
* Say you roll three dice, one by one. What is the probability that you obtain 3 numbers in a strictly increasing order? 5/54
* What is the expected number of coin flips needed to get two consecutive heads? 6
