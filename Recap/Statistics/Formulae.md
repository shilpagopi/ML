# Formulae
Multinomial distribution:
* The expected number of times the outcome i was observed over n trials is: E(Xi) = n* pi
* Var(Xi) = n* pi(1-pi)
* Cov(Xi,Xj) = -n * pi * pj
* Correlation(Xi,Xj) = Cov(Xi,Xj)/Sqrt(Var(Xi) * Var(Yi))

Discrete uniform distribution (over integers a,a+1,...,b):
* E(X) = a+b/2
* Var(X)= ((b−a+1)^2-1)/12

### Types of distributions
> Multinomial distribution is a generalization of the binomial distribution. It models the probability of counts for each side of a k-sided die rolled n times.  
> k=2,n=1: Bernoulli distribution   
> k=2,n>1: Binomial distribution  
> k>2,n=1: Categorical distribution

 > Discrete uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution where every possible outcome within a given finite set has an equal probability of occurring. eg. rolling a fair six-sided die.
Key Characteristics: Discrete Outcomes,Finite Set of Outcomes,Equal Probability

> PMF(probability mass function): P(X=x)= 1/n
> ​Mean and Variance for a discrete uniform distribution over integers a,a+1,...,b:

> Mean (Expected Value): E[X]= a+b/2
> ​For a standard die (a=1,b=6), the mean is (1+6)/2=3.5.
> Variance: Var(X)= ((b−a+1)^2-1)/12
> For a standard die, n=(6−1+1)=6. So, the variance is (6^2−1)/12=(36−1)/12=35/12≈2.9167.
