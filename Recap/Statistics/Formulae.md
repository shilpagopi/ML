# Formulae
Multinomial distribution:
* The expected number of times the outcome i was observed over n trials is: E(Xi) = n* pi
* Var(Xi) = n* pi(1-pi)
* Cov(Xi,Xj) = -n * pi * pj
* Correlation(Xi,Xj) = Cov(Xi,Xj)/Sqrt(Var(Xi) * Var(Yi))

### Types of distributions
> Multinomial distribution is a generalization of the binomial distribution. It models the probability of counts for each side of a k-sided die rolled n times.  
> k=2,n=1: Bernoulli distribution   
> k=2,n>1: Binomial distribution  
> k>2,n=1: Categorical distribution
