# EigenVectors and EigenValues
* Eigenvectors: unit vectors
* A . v = lambda . v, where A is a sqaure parent matrix
* Not all square matrices can be decomposed into eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and some can only be decomposed in a way that requires complex numbers
* 
A = Qdiag(V)Q^-1
1
A = Qdiag(V)Q^-1
Where Q is a matrix comprised of the eigenvectors, diag(V) is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues, and Q^-1 is the inverse of the matrix comprised of the eigenvectors.
