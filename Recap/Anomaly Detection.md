# Anomaly Detection
Point anomaly, Contextual anomaly,Collective Anomaly

#### Types of Techniques
* Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques assume that anomalies are rare in dataset
* Supervised anomaly detection techniques work like binary classifiers (problem of unbalanced data)
* Common assumption: anomalies are statistically different from normal instances

#### Techniques
Density-based techniques (k-nearest neighbor,local outlier factor,isolation forests)  
Subspace correlation-based and tensor-based   
One-class support vector machines  
Replicator neural networks.autoencoders, variational autoencoders,long short-term memory neural networks  
Bayesian networks  
Hidden Markov models (HMMs)  
Cluster analysis-based outlier detection  
Deviations from association rules and frequent itemsets.  
Fuzzy logic-based outlier detection.  
Ensemble techniques, using feature bagging,score normalization and different sources of diversity  
DBSCAN  
Isolation Forests  
Local Outlier Factor  
Elliptic Envelope  
One-Class Support Vector Machines
