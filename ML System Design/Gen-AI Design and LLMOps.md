# Gen-AI Design and LLMOps

#### Architecture
* Off-the-shelf APIs are fast to deploy, require less maintenance, and offer high performance but come with a higher cost, less control, and potential data privacy concerns.
* Open-source models offer full control, better cost management for high volume, and data privacy but require significant infrastructure and MLOps expertise.
* A single large model is simpler to manage but can be expensive and inefficient for varied tasks. A combination of specialized models (e.g., one for summarization, another for Q&A) can be more cost-effective and performant but adds architectural complexity.
* RAG vs Finetuning: RAG brings in latency

### Deployment
*  FastAPI is great for a simple REST API wrapper, while Triton Inference Server is a specialized tool for high-throughput, low-latency model serving.  Deploy on GPUs/TPUs with Triton or vLLM for efficient serving.
* For deploying LLMs, a cloud-based managed service like AWS SageMaker or Azure AI is often preferred over a self-hosted solution.
While self-hosting offers full control and data privacy, it requires significant upfront investment and specialized expertise (lacks built-in features for GPU resource allocation and autoscaling)

### Monitoring and Observability
* Model Performance Metrics: Latency, Throughput, Hallucination Rate, Content Safety Score: A score from a secondary filter model indicating the level of toxicity, bias, or hate speech.
* Business Metrics: User Engagement, First-Time Resolution Rate (For a chatbot), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)

* Data Drift: Monitor the distribution of incoming prompts. If the input data starts to change significantly (e.g., new slang, different topics), it can signal data drift. You can use statistical tests or monitor the cosine similarity of incoming embeddings to a baseline.

* Concept Drift: Track key model performance and business metrics over time. A sustained decline in accuracy, resolution rate, or user satisfaction can indicate that the underlying concepts the model was trained on are no longer relevant. For example, a chatbot might start performing poorly if user language shifts from formal to casual.

* Cadence for model updates and retraining

### Cost and Latency Optimization
* Optimizing the inference stack (e.g., with frameworks like TensorRT), using smaller/distilled models, quantizing models, using spot instances?
* Prompt caching, prompt-optimization, output optimization for token-based billing, Tiered Model Strategy (route simpler tasks to cheaper models)
* Caching repeated requests

### Scaling & Bottlenecks
* High-volume traffic: autoscaling, load balancing, and model parallelism (e.g., sharding a large model across multiple GPUs). 
* Bottlenecks: GPU memory, I/O latency (especially with RAG), network latency, and the LLM's inherent processing time.

### Safety and Responsible AI üõ°Ô∏è
* Safety Filters: Implement a multi-layered safety stack: pre-filter on the user's input to block harmful prompts and a post-filter on the model's output to detect and prevent the generation of toxic or biased content. 
* Bias Mitigation: addressed by fine-tuning the model on a more diverse dataset or by adjusting the safety filters to prevent biased responses.
