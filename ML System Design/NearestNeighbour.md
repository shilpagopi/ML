# Nearest Neighbour
* Exact nearest neighbor: time complexity is O(NÃ—D) where N is the total number of points and D is the point dimension.
* Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN): reduce the time complexity of NN search to sublinear via efficient data structures
  * Tree-based ANN  :R-trees, Kd-trees, and Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbor Oh Yeah)
  * Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-based ANN

  * Clustering-based ANN
  * Implementations: Faiss (developed by Meta) and ScaNN (developed by Google)
