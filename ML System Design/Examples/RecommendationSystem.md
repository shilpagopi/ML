### Two-tower neural network
Two-tower neural networks are used for both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. When a two-tower architecture is used for collaborative filtering, the video encoder is nothing but an embedding layer that converts the video ID into an embedding vector. This way, the model doesn't rely on other video features.
