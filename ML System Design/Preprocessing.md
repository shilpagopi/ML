## Image Preprocessing
Resizing: Models usually require fixed image sizes (e.g., 224Ã—224)
Scaling: Scale pixel values of the image to the range of 0 and 1
Z-score normalization: Scale pixel values to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1
Consistent : Ensuring images have a consistent color mode (e.g., RGB or CMYK)
