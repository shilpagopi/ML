# Graph Neural Networks
##### Why are GNNs Necessary?
* Arbitrary Size and Complex Topology
* No Fixed Order: No inherent order. Permuting the order of nodes should not change the graph's properties or the model's output (permutation invariance/equivariance).
* Local Connectivity: Information in graphs is often local, determined by immediate neighbors. CNNs use fixed filters, which don't generalize to arbitrary graph structures.
GNNs address these challenges by extending the principles of deep learning to capture both the features of individual nodes/edges and the structural relationships within the graph.
